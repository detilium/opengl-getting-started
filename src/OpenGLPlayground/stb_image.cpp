#define STB_IMAGE_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "stb_image.h"

// std_image.h is a single head file library used to load various image type, such as png, jpeg, tga, etc.
// Basically we're using std_image.h instead of writing our own image loader, because we're lazy and why would we reinvent the wheel? :)
